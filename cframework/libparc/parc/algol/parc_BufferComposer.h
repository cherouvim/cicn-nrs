/**
 * @file parc_BufferComposer.h
 * @ingroup memory
 * @brief An elastic memory composer of PARCBuffer instances.
 *
 * A `PARCBufferComposer` is a dynamically allocated buffer that can be used to incrementally add (append)
 * intrinsic values and/or `PARCBuffer` instance contents to a single location. It is meant to be a general
 * purpose buffer in that all native types may be added to the buffer. When finished, the user can finalize
 * the composer and produce a flipped `PARCBuffer` instance.
