/**
 * A thread-safe fixed size ring buffer.
 *
 * A single-producer/single-consumer version is lock-free, along the lines of Lamport, "Proving the
 * Correctness of Multiprocess Programs," IEEE Trans on Software Engineering 3(2), Mar 1977, which
 * is based on reading/writing native types upto the data bus width being atomic operations.
 *
 * It can hold (elements-1) data items.  elements must be a power of 2.
 *
 * The writer_head is where the next element should be inserted.  The reader_tail is where the next element
 * should be read.
 *
 * All index variables are unbounded uint32_t.  This means they just keep counting up.  To get the actual
 * index in the ring, we mask with (elements-1).  For example, a ring with 16 elements will be masked with
 * 0x0000000F.  We call this the "ring_mask".
 *
 * Because we never let the writer_head and reader_tail differ by more than (elements-1), this technique of
 * masking works just the same as taking the modulus.  There's no problems at the uint32_t wraparound either.
 * The only math operation we are doing is "+1" which works just fine to wrap a uint32_t.
 *
 * Let's look at some exampls.  I'm going to use a uint16_t so its easier to write the numbers.  Let's assume
 * that the ring size is 16, so the first ring is (0 - 15).
 *              head     tail
 * initialize      0        0
 * put x 3         3        0
 * get x 2         3        2
 * put x 13       16        2
 * put x 1        17        2
 * put x 1      blocks          # (0x11 + 1) & 0x0F  == tail & 0x0F
 * get x 14       17       16
 * get x 1        17       17   # ring is now empty
 * ...
 * empty       65534    65534   # 0xFFFE  0xFFFE masked =  14   14
 * put x1      65535    65534   # 0xFFFF  0xFFFE masked =  15   14
 * put x1          0    65534   # 0x0000  0xFFFE masked =   0   14
 * ...
 *
 * The number of remaining available items is (ring_mask + reader_tail - writer_head) & ring_mask.
 *              head     tail   remaining
 * initialize      0        0   15 + 0 - 0 = 15
 * put x 3         3        0   15 + 0 - 3 = 12
 * get x 2         3        2
 * put x 13       16        2   15 + 2 - 16 = 1
 * put x 1        17        2   15 + 2 - 17 = 0
 * put x 1      blocks
 * get x 14       17       16   15 + 16 - 17 = 14
 * get x 1        17       17   15 + 17 - 17 = 15
 * ...
 * empty       65534    65534   15 + 65534 - 65534 = 13 - 65534 = 13 - (-2) = 15
 * put x1      65535    65534   15 + 65534 - 65535 = 13 - 65535 = 13 - (-1) = 14
 * put x1          0    65534   15 + 65534 -     0 = 13 - 65535 = 13 - ( 0) = 13
 * ...
 *
 * If (writer_head + 1) & ring_mask == reader_tail, then the ring is full.
 * If writer_head == reader_tail, then the ring is empty.
